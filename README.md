In this data science project, I embarked on building a classification model using Naive Bayes to predict the salary of individuals based on various demographic and employment-related features. Leveraging the inherent assumptions of Naive Bayes and the provided dataset containing information about individuals' attributes and salaries, I aimed to develop a robust model for salary classification. Here's an overview of the project:
 
Problem Statement:
 
The primary objective of the project was to develop a classification model using Naive Bayes to predict the salary of individuals based on demographic and employment-related attributes. The dataset, consisting of two files "SalaryData_Train.csv" and "SalaryData_Test.csv," contained features such as age, education, occupation, marital status, capital gain, capital loss, and hours worked per week. The goal was to train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data to predict whether an individual's salary exceeds a certain threshold.
 
Approach:
 
The project followed a systematic approach to model development and evaluation, encompassing the following key steps:
 
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
 - Exploring the datasets to understand the distribution and characteristics of features.
 - Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features if necessary.
 
2. Model Training using Naive Bayes:
 - Implementing the Naive Bayes algorithm to build a classification model for predicting salary.
 - Leveraging the multinomial or Gaussian Naive Bayes variant depending on the nature of the features (categorical or continuous).
 
3. Model Evaluation:
 - Splitting the data into training and test sets to train the model and evaluate its performance.
 - Assessing the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
 - Utilizing cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and generalization of the model.
 
4. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):
 - Conducting hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
 - Exploring different parameter combinations to improve the model's predictive accuracy.
 
5. Deployment and Integration:
 - Integrating the trained model into a user-friendly interface or application for making real-time salary predictions.
 - Deploying the model to production environments for practical usage and decision support.
